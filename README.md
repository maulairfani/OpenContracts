## What is OpenContracts?

OpenContracts is an AGPL-3.0 licensed platform for document analysis, annotation, and collaboration. It combines document management with AI-powered analysis tools, discussion threads, and structured data extraction.

### Core Capabilities

- **Document Processing** — Upload PDFs and text files, automatically extract structure with ML-based parsers
- **Annotation & Analysis** — Highlight, label, and analyze documents with custom annotation schemas
- **AI Agents** — Chat with documents using configurable AI assistants that can search and analyze content
- **Collaboration** — Threaded discussions with @mentions, voting, and moderation at corpus and document levels
- **Data Extraction** — Extract structured data from hundreds of documents using agent-powered queries
- **Version Control** — Track document changes, restore previous versions, soft delete with recovery

## Features

### Document Management
- Organize documents into collections (Corpuses) with folder hierarchies
- Fine-grained permissions with public/private visibility controls
- Document versioning with full history and restore capability
- Bulk upload and batch operations

### Parsing & Processing
- Pluggable parser architecture supporting multiple backends:
  - [Docling](docs/pipelines/docling_parser.md) — ML-based structure extraction (default)
  - [LlamaParse](docs/pipelines/llamaparse_parser.md) — Cloud-based parsing with layout extraction
  - Text/Markdown — Simple text extraction
- Automatic vector embeddings for semantic search (powered by pgvector)
- Structural annotation extraction (headers, paragraphs, tables)

### Annotation Tools
- Multi-page annotation support
- Custom label schemas with validation
- Relationship mapping between annotations
- Import/export in standard formats

### AI & LLM Integration
- Built on [PydanticAI](docs/architecture/llms/README.md) for structured LLM interactions
- Configurable AI agents with tool access (search, document loading, annotation queries)
- Real-time streaming responses via WebSocket
- Conversation history with context management

### Collaboration (New in v3.0.0.b3)
- Threaded discussions at global, corpus, and document levels
- @mentions for documents, corpuses, and AI agents
- Upvoting/downvoting with reputation tracking
- Thread pinning, locking, and moderation controls
- User profiles with activity feeds and statistics
- Badges and achievements for community engagement
- Leaderboards showing top contributors

### Data Extraction
- Define extraction schemas with multiple question types
- Run extractions across document collections
- Review and validate extracted data in grid view
- Export results in structured formats

## Architecture

### Data Format

OpenContracts uses a standardized format for representing text and layout on PDF pages, enabling portable annotations across tools:

![Data Format](docs/assets/images/diagrams/pawls-annotation-mapping.svg)

### Processing Pipeline

The modular pipeline supports custom parsers, embedders, and thumbnail generators:

![Pipeline Diagram](docs/assets/images/diagrams/parser_pipeline.svg)

Each component inherits from a base class with a defined interface:
- **Parsers** — Extract text and structure from documents
- **Embedders** — Generate vector embeddings for search
- **Thumbnailers** — Create document previews

See the [pipeline documentation](docs/pipelines/pipeline_overview.md) for details on creating custom components.

---

## Deployment

### Quick Start (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JSv4/OpenContracts.git
cd OpenContracts
docker compose -f local.yml up
```

### Production

Run migrations before starting services:

```bash
# Apply database migrations
docker compose -f production.yml --profile migrate up migrate

# Start services
docker compose -f production.yml up -d
```

The migration service runs once to avoid race conditions and ensures all tables are created before dependent services start.

---

## Telemetry

OpenContracts collects anonymous usage data to guide development priorities. We collect:
- Installation events (unique installation ID)
- Feature usage statistics (analyzer runs, extracts created)
- Aggregate counts (documents, users, queries)

We do not collect document contents, extracted data, user identities, or query contents.

### Disabling Telemetry

**Backend telemetry** (server-side events): Set `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=False` in your Django settings.

**Frontend analytics** (browser-side tracking via PostHog): Leave `REACT_APP_POSTHOG_API_KEY` unset or empty in `frontend/public/env-config.js`. The frontend also respects the browser's Do Not Track setting and requires explicit user consent before any tracking occurs.

---

## Supported Formats

Currently supported:
- PDF (full layout and annotation support)
- Text-based formats (plaintext, Markdown)

**Coming soon:** DOCX viewing and annotation powered by [Docxodus](https://github.com/JSv4/Docxodus), an open source in-browser Word document viewer. This will enable the same annotation and analysis workflows for Word documents that currently exist for PDFs.

- [NLMatics nlm-ingestor](https://github.com/nlmatics/nlm-ingestor) — Document parsing pipeline

The data extraction grid UI draws inspiration from NLMatics' innovative approach to document querying:
