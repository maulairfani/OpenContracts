## Key Principles Applied

1. **No inline code** - All code examples replaced with links to source files
2. **Accurate paths** - All file paths verified to exist
3. **Current terminology** - Updated deprecated names (Tesseract→Docling, LlamaIndex→PydanticAI, etc.)
4. **Correct architecture** - DocumentPath is source of truth for corpus-document relationships

---

## Document-to-Corpus Relationship Summary

### Source of Truth
- **`DocumentPath`** is the single source of truth for corpus-document relationships
- Legacy M2M field `Corpus.documents` exists for backward compatibility but should NOT be used directly

### Correct Methods
```python
# Add existing document to corpus
corpus.add_document(document=doc, user=user)

# Or via service with full permission checks
DocumentFolderService.add_document_to_corpus(user, document, corpus)

# Get documents in corpus
corpus.get_documents()

# Count documents
corpus.document_count()
```

### Deprecated (Do Not Use)
```python
# These bypass versioning and create inconsistent state
corpus.documents.add(doc)      # WRONG
corpus.documents.all()         # WRONG
corpus.documents.count()       # WRONG
```
