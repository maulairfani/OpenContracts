"""
Utilities for mitigating prompt injection when embedding user-controlled
content inside LLM prompts.

The core defence is an XML-style *data fence*: user content is wrapped in
``<user_content>`` / ``</user_content>`` tags so the model can clearly
distinguish instructions from untrusted data.  A companion constant-based
warning is injected into instruction sections to reinforce the boundary.
